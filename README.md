Works but is not deployed. Ask The-Code-Whisperer to deploy it and give you the link.

Or clone the repo, install the cs50 library and flask, possibly others. Export the API_KEY as a free API_KEY you can get from https://iexcloud.io/ (write export API_KEY=yourfreekeyhere and set flask_app=application.py)

flask run and you're good to go!
